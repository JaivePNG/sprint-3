What happens to the site when I resize the screen site to 500px or less resolution?

At this point, the site responds the browsers change in width site, which triggers the media queries set in the css which are linked to it in the styles.
The columns are ordered and hence will follow the order which they are set at. This ensures that the content of the website fits perfectly and fluidly in the browser window, whatever the size of teh window is. This is responsive design.
