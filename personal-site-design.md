I have done two github sites - these are:
---------------------------------------------------------------
a) Steeple Chasing Colums and Grids : jaivepng.github.io
b) Black Bear Rising: squadpng.github.io
---------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Purpose of Steeple Chasing Colums and Grids?

The purpose of the website is to document my learning experience through the Enspiral Dev Program.

The Sites Primary Audience?

My primary audience is my cohort and others in the program, as well as my evolving self.

How Do We Want the Audience to Interact With the Site?

I want them to use their phones and small screen devices to access the website and see all the changes etc.

How Will I Build the Site to Support This Goal?

I will use skeleton framework to build a simple, clean and responsive site that gets the job done. It can be viewed on both mobile and larger devices, with minimum media query.
