What is the Purpose of Black Bar Rising?

The purpose of the website, which you can find here, squadpng.github.io, is to raise awarness of the plight of Black Bears and their cousins in the bear family.

The Sites Primary Audience?

We want people who are concerned about bears and the fight to save some of them, to learn more through the website.

How Do We Want the Audience to Interact With the Site?

We want them to see the images, read the articles and follow the links to support organisations that work with bears in the wild.

How Will I Build the Site to Support This Goal?

I will use skeleton framework to build a simple, clean and responsive site that gets the job done. It can be viewed on both mobile and larger devices, with minimum media query.
